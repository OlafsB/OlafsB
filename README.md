- 👋 Hi, I’m @Olafs
- 👀 I’m interested in watches, biographies, Italian food and manufacturing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development at Udemy (bought a bootcamp) and soon will be enrolled in a life-long course... again on web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects. Still learning here. I hold a Master's in Legal translation, but considering that there is no real future with those skills I am learning something new.
Fun fact, before translation I studied IT, but did not consider myself back then a computer guy. It may be due to lack of knowledge and experience with code and computers back then.
So now I am devoting all my free time and vacation-days to learning new stuff. SEO and digital marketing is of more interest, but need to know code basics to be good at the other.
